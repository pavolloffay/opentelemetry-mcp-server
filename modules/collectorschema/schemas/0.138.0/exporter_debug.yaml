            block_on_overflow:
                description: BlockOnOverflow determines the behavior when the component's TotalSize limit is reached. If true, the component will wait for space; otherwise, operations will immediately return a retryable error.

                description: NumConsumers is the maximum number of concurrent consumers from the queue. This applies across all different optional configurations from above (e.g. wait_for_result, block_on_overflow, storage, etc.).

            storage:
                description: 'StorageID if not empty, enables the persistent storage and uses the component specified as a storage extension for the persistent queue. TODO: This will be changed to Optional when available. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/13822'
