## v0.139.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/sqlserver`: Standardizing the unit interpretation of lookback_time in config for top query collection (#43573)
  Like other interval related config values, lookback_time also should suffix 's' to represent time in seconds.
  

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `connector/count`: Support for setting attributes from scope and resource levels. Precedence order: Span (or Log Record, etc.) > Scope attributes > Resource attributes. (#41859)
- `connector/spanmetrics`: Add `add_resource_attributes` opt-in config option to keep resource attributes in generated metrics (#43394)
  This configuration option allows users to override the `connector.spanmetrics.excludeResourceMetrics` feature gate
  and restore the old behavior of including resource attributes in metrics. This is needed for customers whose
  existing dashboards depend on resource attributes being present in the generated metrics.
  
- `exporter/azuremonitor`: Add authenticator extension support to the Azure Monitor exporter. (#41004)
- `exporter/azuremonitor`: Updated azure monitor exporter to use OTEL semantic conventions 1.34.0 (#41289)

  There's also on optional setting to aggregate received metrics into a single metric to keep the original name, instead of multiply the metrics by added suffixes `_total`, `_sum`, `_max` etc.
  
- `receiver/ciscoosreceiver`: `ciscoosreceiver`: Add new receiver for collecting metrics from Cisco network devices via SSH (#42647)
  Supports Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, and NX-OS devices with SSH-based metric collection.
  Initial implementation includes system scraper for device availability and connection metrics.

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `exporter/clickhouse`: Fix a bug in the exporter factory resulting in a nil dereference panic when the clickhouse.json feature gate is enabled (#43733)
- `exporter/kafka`: franz-go: Fix underreported kafka_exporter_write_latency metric (#43803)
- `exporter/loadbalancing`: Fix high cardinality issue in loadbalancing exporter by moving endpoint from exporter ID to attributes (#43719)
  Previously, the exporter created unique IDs for each backend endpoint by appending the endpoint
  to the exporter ID (e.g., loadbalancing_10.11.68.62:4317). This caused high cardinality in metrics,
  especially in dynamic environments. Now the endpoint is added as an attribute instead.
  
- `exporter/pulsar`: Fix the oauth2 flow for pulsar exporter by adding additional configuration fields (#435960)
  Fixes the oauth2 authentication flow in pulsar exporter by exposing additional configuration like `private_key` and `scope`.
- `processor/metricstarttime`: Do not set start timestamp if it is already set. (#43739)
- `processor/tail_sampling`: Fix panic when invalid regex was sent to string_attribute sampler (#43735)
- `receiver/awss3`: Fix S3 prefix trimming logic in awss3reader to correctly handle empty, single slash '/', and double slash '//' prefixes. (#43587)
  This fix ensures the S3 object prefix is generated consistently for all prefix formats (e.g., `""`, `/`, `//`, `/logs/`, `//raw//`),
  preventing malformed S3 paths when reading from buckets with non-standard prefixes.
  
- `receiver/hostmetrics`: Allow process metrics to be recorded if the host does not have cgroup functionality (#43640)
- `receiver/kafka`: Corrected the documentation for the Kafka receiver to accurately the supported/default group balancer strategies. (#43892)

- `receiver/prometheus`: Fix missing staleness tracking leading to missing no recorded value data points. (#43893)
- `receiver/prometheusremotewrite`: Fixed a concurrency bug in the Prometheus remote write receiver where concurrent requests with identical job/instance labels would return empty responses after the first successful request. (#42159)
- `receiver/pulsar`: Fix the oauth2 flow for pulsar exporter by adding additional configuration fields (#435960)
  Fixes the oauth2 authentication flow in pulsar receiver by exposing additional configuration like `private_key` and `scope`.
  
- `receiver/receiver_creator`: Fix annotation-discovery config unmarshaling for nested configs (#43730)

## v1.45.0/v0.139.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `cmd/mdatagen`: Make stability.level a required field for metrics (#14070)
- `cmd/mdatagen`: Replace `optional` field with `requirement_level` field for attributes in metadata schema (#13913)
  The `optional` boolean field for attributes has been replaced with a `requirement_level` field that accepts enum values: `required`, `conditionally_required`, `recommended`, or `opt_in`.
  - `required`: attribute is always included and cannot be excluded
  - `conditionally_required`: attribute is included by default when certain conditions are met (replaces `optional: true`)
  - `recommended`: attribute is included by default but can be disabled via configuration (replaces `optional: false`)
  - `opt_in`: attribute is not included unless explicitly enabled in user config
  When `requirement_level` is not specified, it defaults to `recommended`.
